This set of packages works with different types of color aggregations. Each aggregation is needed to work specifically with TypeScript.

## ColorFormats

This interface can contain every format and can select a specific color format by its format name.

### Type

Each value should be as its interface or type specifies, read about [format](/formats) types to know more.

```js
interface ColorFormats {
  cmyk?: Cmyk
  hex?: Hex
  hsl?: Hsl
  hsv?: Hsv
  lab?: Lab
  rgb?: Rgb
  xyz?: Xyz
}

// Examples
const colors: ColorFormats = {
  hex: '#42D37A',
  rgb: { r: 66, g: 211, b: 122 }
}

const otherColors: ColorFormats = {
  hsl: { h: 143, s: 62, l: 54 },
  hsv: { h: 143, s: 69, v: 83 }
}
```

<hr/>



## BaseColor

This type determines whether a value is of type Cmyk, Hex, Hsl, Hsv, or Rgb. The Lab and XYZ formats are excluded because they are imprecise when converting between types.

### Type

Each value should be as its interface or type specifies, read about [format](/formats) types to know more.

```js
type BaseColor = Cmyk | Hex | Hsl | Hsv | Rgb;

// Examples
const color: BaseColor = '#42D37A'

const otherColor: BaseColor = { r: 66, g: 211, b: 122 };
```

## AnyFormat

This type determines whether a value is of type Cmyk, Hex, Hsl, Hsv, Lab, Rgb, or Xyz. This type is used in this set of packages as a return type cause it contains imprecise types like Lab and Xyz.

### Type

Each value should be as its interface or type specifies, read about [format](/formats) types to know more.

```js
type AnyFormat = Cmyk | Hex | Hsl | Hsv | Lab | Rgb | Xyz

// Examples
const color: AnyFormat = '#42D37A'

const rgbColor: AnyFormat = { r: 66, g: 211, b: 122 }

const labColor: AnyFormat = { l: 76, a: -58, b: 33 }
```
