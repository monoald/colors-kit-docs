## What is Colors JS?

**Colors JS** is a powerful tool that includes a set of JavaScript functions that can help you with a variety of **color-related tasks**, such as:

- Converting colors between different formats
- Creating color palettes
- Rating the contrast of two colors based on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- Generating random colors
- Simulating different types of color blindness
- Extracting color palettes from an image

## Add Color JS to your project

```js
npm install @colors/color-js
```

The **/color-js** package is built in pure TypeScript and can be used on projects that use vanilla JavaScript or any JavaScript framework.

## Basic Usage

In this section, we will see a simple usage of the **/colors-js** package to convert a color to another format.

```js
import { hexToRgb } from "@colors/colors-js";

const hexadecimalColor = "#ff4722";

const rgbColor = hexToRgb(hexadecimalColor); // { r: 255, g: 71, b: 34 }
```
