## What is Colors JS?

**Colors JS** is a powerful tool that includes a set of JavaScript functions that can help you with a variety of **color-related tasks**, such as:

- Converting colors between different formats
- Creating color palettes
- Rating the contrast of two colors based on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- Generating random colors
- Simulating different types of color blindness
- Extracting color palettes from an image

## Add Color JS to your project

```js
npm install @colors/color-js
```

The **color-js** package is built in pure TypeScript and can be used on projects that use vanilla JavaScript or any JavaScript framework.
